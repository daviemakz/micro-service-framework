# Summary

Risen.JS is a framework for building event-driven, efficient, and scalable non-blocking Node.JS server-side applications. It uses ES6+ JavaScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and FP (Functional Programming).

Under the hood, Risen.JS makes use of the well-known and robust [Express](http://expressjs.com) HTTP(s) package, [Quick-DB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quick.db) for long term persistent storage, and the native [child process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) feature in Node.JS. The library also uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to support runtime transpilation of ES6+ code.

Risen.JS provides a level of abstraction above these frameworks but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party modules, packages, and middlewareâ€™s which are available for each platform.

Because the "services" you will create run as independent Node.JS processes, this means you can build microservices utilizing the tens of thousands of NPM packages that currently exist and are added every day. Simply put anything you can do in Node.JS, you can build a microservice to do for you.

To see a tutorial of the application please visit this [link](https://daviemakz.github.io/risen-js/docs/settingup).

_Supports Node 10.x +_

# Installation

To install please follow the below instructions:

## NPM

```sh
npm install risen-js --save
```

## Yarn

```sh
yarn add risen-js
```

# Testing

Run the following commands to run a full test suite of Risen.JS. There is a focus on the end-to-end testing as well as unit tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

# Development

If you would like to add to this project I've made it simple to do so.

## Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daviemakz/risen-js.git
```

## Install the dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start the server

To run the development server against the full test suite, you simply execute:

```sh
yarn dev:server
```

As you make changes all the tests will execute automatically, allowing you to easily develop new features in the framework.
